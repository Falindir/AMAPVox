help_hemiphoto=The tab "From hemi scans" mean that the hemispherical photography is generated from the lidar scans.\n\
The scans should be at the same position.\n\
The most important is to have an hemispherical cover.\n\n\
The tab "From PAD" allows you to generate an hemispherical photography from a voxel file, using the PAD values.
help_empty_shots_filter= Artificial empty shots may be provided by Riegl TLS scanners for objects too close to the sensor (around 1m).\n\
This option allows to remove those "false" empty shots.
help_3D_viewer=The mode 1 allows you to visualize a voxel space file selected in the bottom right list.\n\
You can also display a raster in ascii grid format (*.asc) at the same time as the voxel file.\n\n\
The mode 2 is a new more flexible 3d item viewer. You can display in it as many element as you want.\n\
The supported formats right now are : \n\
\t-Rasters :\n\
\t\t-Ascii grid format (*.asc)\n\n\
\t-Point clouds:\n\
\t\t-rxp, rsp\n\
\t\t-las, laz\n\
\t\t-ptx, ptg\n\
\t\t-csv file (values separated by columns)\n\n\
\t-Voxel file: it is inadisable, use mode 1 for this purpose\n\n
